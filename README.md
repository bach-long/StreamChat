# Resource
* [StreamChat third party](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/) - a third party that provides the database, web socket service and UIcomponent,... It gives us almost everything we need for a Chat application.
* [Firebase storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/) - a cloud storage we can use for store files, images,...., I use this to store user avatar 
* [Agora](https://www.agora.io/en/) An SDK help us to implement video and audio chat easily, Im succeeded in implementing it, though I'm still struggling with the UI
and ofcourse, many sources from google

# How I started:
Recently, I have some interests in Realtime relating technologies, I have come to socket.Io since the begining and struggling with it for 2,3 days. The purpose from start is trying to learn as much as possible while accomplishing the product in time, but I relized that building the UI and learn how to control the web socket in the sametime is quite a challenge for newbie. I surfed the youtube and google, then found those mentioned above. I also found projects that guide me how to use the already done components of StreamChat, in  over a week I read the document(mainly about queries and the flow of it). I tried to folow the guides while fixing it the way I want. Till now, the project is almost done, but I want to implement the video/audio chat, the core is alright but the UI is still not completed. Anyway I'm all new in frontend and this could take much time. I will definitely make it done in the near future, and also refactoring code is one thing I'm thinking a bout
